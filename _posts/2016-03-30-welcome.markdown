## Welcome

I think many blog themes are over designed, so I created this one. 

Just for using, not showing off.

## Nice Blog

A Simple Jekyll Blog Theme.

[Demo](http://gabriel-chen.github.io/Nice_Blog)

![index-page](https://i.imgur.com/BrmOMmv.png)

Introduce yourself in `About` page  :
![about-page](https://i.imgur.com/vRGFclV.png)

And you can turn on or off your skills tree in `_config.yml` :  
![skills-tree](https://i.imgur.com/ssSOj57.png)

Posts will be listed by years in `Archive` page:  
![archive-page](https://i.imgur.com/8bQZtkD.png)

Post will be listed by categories in `Category` page:

Post will be listed by tags in `Tags` page:

You can put your `PGP` publickey in `Contact` page:  
![contact-page](https://i.imgur.com/8wHb5lX.png)

Now you have a `404` page and it will jump back to `index` page itself:

If you add `finshed: true` in your post header, then an `EOF` container will show under your post like this:  
<div class="eof"></div>

Or it will show `TBC`:   
<div class="tbc"></div>

## How to use

Star it, fork it, and download it.

Change the settings in `_config.yml` file and then you can use this theme.

Then change whatever you want. But first, you should know what you are doing.

If you messed it up, do not worry, just come back and clone it again.

Have fun.
